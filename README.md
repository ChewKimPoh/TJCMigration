// Welcome to your new TJC extension.
// Remember that object names and IDs should be unique across all extensions.
// AL snippets start with t*, like tpageext - give them a try and happy coding!

Hi Benny,

I created a new extension TJCMigration.

While you are migrating the C/AL to AL, use the conversion tool. Retain the Object IDs & Field IDs.

However, I like to maintain documentation for the 2 customisations that you listed. Later / future, we might want to split them. Make it easy to do.
